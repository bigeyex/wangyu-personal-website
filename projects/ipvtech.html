    <h3>Goal</h3>
    <p>Empowering domestic violence advocates and the citizenry to understand the relationship between intimate partner abuse, law enforcement and legal mechanisms related to digital surveillance.</p>

    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>We seek to build a dataset showing the relationship between police report logs and cases filed in relation to the use of digital surveillance in the realm of domestic violence. The portal also seeks to help survivors of domestic violence by giving them a safe environment through which they could report incidents of digital surveillance they are facing. Data aggregated from police logs and the data collected from survivors will help advocates identify common technologies used and how to help survivors report to the police on the use of digital surveillance in situations of domestic abuse.</p>
