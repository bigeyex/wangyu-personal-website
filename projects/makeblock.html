    <h3>Goal</h3>
    <p>Provide an iOS app to control educational robots with the capability to extend the robot by buying extra parts and program with a graphical-based language.</p>

    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Makeblock is a company making mechanical/electronic components for makers and educational robots. They need an APP to let the user control their robots. Since they sell electronic parts, they need to give users the ability to customize their controll experience as much as possible. In this APP, users can define and remix control panels (or "command centers") by dragging and dropping componets and program/reprogram their behavior in Blockly drag-and-drop programming language (the idea works in a similar way to modern IDEs like Visual Basic). In this way, users can experience how leanring programming giving them power to reshape the environment around them. </p>
