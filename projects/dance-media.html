    <h3>Goal</h3>
    <p>This hackathon project visualizes subtle movements of the dancers, enabling dancing learners to have a better grasp of dancers' movement and enhancing spectators' experience.</p>

    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>In a two-day hackathon, our team of two wired up homebrewed feet pressure sensors and movement sensors, and programmed Arduino microcontroller to display strength of movements with LED strips.  This wearable device can also collect data for later use or other types of visualization.</p>

    <h3>Team</h3>
    <p>David Wang, Yu Wang</p>

    <h3>My Role</h3>
    <p>circuits, soldering, and Arduino programming.</p>
