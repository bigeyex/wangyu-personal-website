    <h3>Goal</h3>
    <p>provide a way to compare different metrics for evaluating nonprofits (NGOs); provoke thinking on difference between subjective (review by stakeholders, volunteers, etc.) and objective (financial score, transparency score) metrics.</p>

    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This project scraped data from GreatNonprofits.org, a major nonprofits evaluation database featured by user-generated reviews; and data from charityNavigator.org, a website that collect data from public sources (such as 501c table) and synthesize scores for NGOs. This program juxtaposes scores from two different data sources together, and allow users to display/rank by specific metric items for further research.</p>
