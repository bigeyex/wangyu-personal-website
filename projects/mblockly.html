    <h3>Goal</h3>
    <p>Help children to get in touch with entry-level programming as easily as possible.</p>

    <h3>Description (from App Store)</h3>
    <p><b>LET YOUR ROBOT FEEL, THINK, AND DANCE</b><br/>
<br/>
With mBlockly, your mBot robot may perceive distance via ultrasonic sensors, mind its feet through line-tracking sensors, and be afraid of dark with its lightness sensor. Build short programs to let your mBot move or sing a little song when it is happy or sad.<br/>
<br/>
<b>TAKE YOUR MBOT WITH YOUR TRIP</b><br/>
<br/>
Computers and cables are no more needed. Your iPad communicate directly with your mBot via bluetooth.<br/>
<br/>
<b>TURN YOUR IPADS INTO MAGIC WANDS</b><br/>
<br/>
mBlockly can read the status of iPad's gyroscope, meaning that you may let your mBot dance by shaking the iPad or tilting it to each direction.</p>
