    <h3>Goal</h3>
    <p>allow non-Chinese speaking people search for Chinese news and social media content in a single web interface</p>

    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>searches are first translated from English to Chinese using Baidu translate API, then searches are performed via Baidu News Search; the result is translated back to English for reading. <br/>The version in Github uses web sockets, so results are shown up one by one. The server which hosts the demo site does not support web sockets, so the speed of the demo site might be a bit of slow.</p>
