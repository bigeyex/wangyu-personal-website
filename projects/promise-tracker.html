    <h3>Goal</h3>
    <p>This tool is designed to let citizens hold elected leaders accountable for the promises they made by gathering informed communities and equipping them with easy-to-use data tools. </p>

    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Promise Tracker includes a form builder and mobile phone tool for data collection, allowing citizens to deploy data collection campaigns based around specific government commitments. The tool is currently being built and tested in partnership with organizations in Belo Horizonte and Sao Paulo, Brazil (from <a href="http://promisetracker.org/">project page</a>).</p>

    <h3>Team</h3>
    <p><a href="https://civic.mit.edu/promise-tracker">a team of 9 people</a></p>

    <h3>My Role</h3>
    <p>I built the early prototype, whose design and technology architectural choices heavily lead to the final project. I also wrote code for the mobile app and developed map visualization modules.</p>
