    <h3>Goal</h3>
    <p>The goal of this project is to build a digital humanities game that enables children to explore Chinese poetry. The visual and textual interface allows users to explore poems through both reading and visually identifying elements in the poems. This allows children to engage playfully with poetry, improving their reading and textual interpretation skills. </p>

    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>     The project is a web-based game. Uusers can choose from a variety of poems (the poem titles appear in Chinese and English). Users can also filter the poems according to the tokens (images) in each poem.<br/> 
    The game can be played in two forms. In the <i>classical form</i>, after selecting a poem, the user sees the poem with select words missing, and a library of tokens is displayed on the right side of the poem. To play the game, users try to place the tokens on the appropriate blank slots in the poem. As they place the tokens correctly, the tokens accrue at the bottom of the interface (collecting tokens is like collecting points). In the <i>creative form</i>, users can rearrange words and phrases in the poem to create new poetic meaning. </p>
