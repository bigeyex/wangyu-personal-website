Civic Coding Collector (CCC) a tool designed for creating long-term engagement in civic coding activities. It encourage cross-sector (coder, designer, activist; new-comers, veterans) participation around civic coding topics.</p>

    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>CCC allow the user to collect Github repositories(repos) related to civic coding. After installing a Google Chrome extension, users can bookmark Github repos in the reposâ€™ project pages by clicking a button. After that, users may add descriptions, add the repo to one of the lists, and discuss with other users. <br/>This project also includes a web backend, allowing users to create lists, reply in discussions, and submit ideas related to civic coding. <br/>This project is still at prototyping stage.</p>
