    <h3>Goal</h3>
    <p>develop an ios app to visualize and collect data expressed by audio frequency signals.</p>

    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p><a href="http://publiclab.org/">Public Lab</a> have a project that transform water conductivity readings to sound signals, allowing children to "listen to" conductivity of the water and have a acoustic feeling of data. This app further allow people to plug a wire in there cellphone to have a visualized understanding of sound frequencies, collect data in a certain period, and calculate the error margins.</p>
